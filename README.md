# Tetris Attack AP
Archipelago mod for Tetris Attack. Requires the USA version of the ROM to play.

Go to the releases to grab the .apworld, then double click or drag into the custom_worlds folder. There, after generating a multiworld, click Open Patch in the Archipelago launcher and select the .aptatk file (as well as the original ROM if it's the first time). Then load the Connector.lua script into Bizhawk to connect to the SNI client.

Source code was written for 0.6.0, but I am pretty sure it works for 0.5.1.

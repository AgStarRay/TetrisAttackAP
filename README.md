# Tetris Attack AP
Archipelago mod for Tetris Attack. Requires the USA version of the ROM to play.

Go to the releases to grab the .apworld, then double click or drag into the custom_worlds folder. There, after generating a multiworld, click Open Patch in the Archipelago launcher and select the .aptatk file (as well as the original ROM if it's the first time). You can also run the .aptatk file itself, but make sure it is unzipped first.
After a compatible emulator opens, load the Connector.lua script from Archipelago/SNI/lua to connect to the SNI client.

Source code was written for 0.6.0, but I am pretty sure it works for 0.5.1.
